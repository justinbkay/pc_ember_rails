This repository is an experiment in ember/rails development.  I'll be trying to convert the peepcode ember application 
into a rails database driven app as apposed to a fixture based app.

I'm using ember-rails, the latest from github.

I'll use ember-data for persistance.

The database is sqlite.

I'll lift css from the peepcode repository.
